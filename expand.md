1. **Why is it important to put thought into your IDs & Classes when it comes to technology intersections? (e.g. how HTML, CSS, and JS intersect)**
   > IDs and class names serve as critical points of connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These identifiers are used for both styling and DOM manipulation, choosing meaningful and consistent names enhances readability, maintainability, and scalability of a project. Poorly chosen IDs or classes can lead to style conflicts, difficult-to-debug behavior, and reduced collaboration efficiency. Being intentional with naming conventions ensures that each part of the codebase communicates clearly with the others and that future developers can easily navigate and extend the project.

2. **What are Data attributes? Why might they be useful? How do you access them? What are the implications of using Data attributes when it comes to things like microdata?**
   > Data attributes are custom HTML attributes that begin with `data-`, allowing developers to embed extra, non-visible information directly within HTML elements. For example, `data-user-id="42"` might be used to associate a user ID with a button. These attributes are useful when passing metadata from HTML to JavaScript in a readable way. In JavaScript, they can be accessed via the dataset property (e.g., `element.dataset.userId`). Using data attributes in place of formal microdata can limit semantic clarity. While `data-*` attributes are useful for storing custom information, they are not recognized by search engines or semantic parsers as structured data. This can reduce the effectiveness of content for SEO and accessibility. For meaningful metadata, standardized microdata attributes like `itemtype` are more appropriate.

3. **What is a DOM fragment? Why are they powerful?**
   > A DOM fragment is a special type of lightweight container, `DocumentFragment`, that acts as a minimal, in-memory version of the DOM. It allows developers to build and modify a set of elements without triggering reflows or repaints in the actual document. This makes DOM fragments powerful for performance optimization when adding multiple elements to a page. Once fully constructed, the fragment can be inserted into the live DOM all at once, reducing the cost of frequent manipulations and improving rendering efficiency.

4. **What is the point of a “Virtual DOM”? What do you gain? What do you lose?**
   > The Virtual DOM is an abstraction used in many modern front-end frameworks, like React, to improve UI performance. Rather than updating the real DOM directly, changes are made to a virtual representation, which is then compared to the previous version using a diffing algorithm. Only the minimal set of necessary changes is then applied to the real DOM. This leads to performance gains, in complex or frequently changing interfaces. However, using a Virtual DOM introduces some overhead, may increase memory usage, and can add complexity when debugging or tracing behavior compared to direct DOM manipulation.

5. **In JavaScript, usually you can reference every attribute of an element with a dot selector followed by the attribute name, except for the class attribute, which is className. Why is this so?**
   > In JavaScript, `class` is a reserved keyword used to define classes in object-oriented programming. To avoid conflict, the DOM API uses `className` instead of `class` when referring to the `class` attribute of an HTML element. This naming convention ensures compatibility with the language syntax while still providing access to the element’s class list. Other attributes with similar conflicts, such as `for`, are accessed with alternative names like `htmlFor` for the same reason.

6. **What is the difference between using addEventListener() and something like onClick() ? What are the advantages / disadvantages of both?**
   > The `addEventListener()` method allows developers to attach multiple event listeners to a single element without overwriting each other. It also supports advanced features such as capturing and bubbling phases, making it more flexible for modern development needs. In contrast, using `onClick` assigns a single function directly to an element’s `onclick` property, replacing any existing handler. While `onClick` is easier to use for quick tasks or small projects, it is less scalable and can lead to code that mixes structure and behavior. `addEventListener()` promotes better separation of concerns and is generally preferred for maintainable and modular codebases.
